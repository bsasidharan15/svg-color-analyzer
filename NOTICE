This software implements a memory-efficient color ensemble for analyzing and extracting dominant colors from SVG files. The implementation includes color space conversion utilities, clustering algorithms, and visualization tools.

This Notice file is part of the Color Ensemble project.

Dependencies:
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- xml.etree.ElementTree
- re (Python standard library)
- collections (Python standard library)

The software utilizes MiniBatchKMeans clustering from scikit-learn for memory-efficient color analysis.

This implementation includes:
1. RGB to hexadecimal color conversion
2. Color extraction from SVG files
3. Memory-efficient color clustering
4. Visualization utilities for color analysis
5. Color swatch generation
